        Quoting <strong>Norvic Philatelics:</strong><br>
        “Mary Leakey (1913-1996) – archaeologist and anthropologist.  An eminent archaeologist and anthropologist, Leakey’s discoveries include the first Proconsul’africanus in 1948 and in 1959 the Zinjanthropus boisei (now known as Australopithecus boisei.) So significant were her finds they forced scientists to change long held views on human evolution.”
